# Central Zoo

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to create a website for a fictional zoo.
The goal of this website was to create it using HTML and CSS.
Below I have outlined different design choices, features of the pages
and what things were used to create this website.

## UX

### User Stories

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

My initial concept was based on a website for Dublin zoo, this was changed after the wireframe stage to have the website made for a fictional zoo.

- [Home page wireframe](/doc-media/doc-wireframes/wireframe-home.png)
- [Animals page wireframe](/doc-media/doc-wireframes/wireframe-animals.png)
- [Gallery page wireframe](/doc-media/doc-wireframes/wireframe-media.png)
- [Contact page wireframe](/doc-media/doc-wireframes/wireframe-contact.png)

Other things changed after the wireframe but the general layout and color scheme stayed the same.

### Color Palette

My initial color palette was picked using a website called 'Coolors'. I picked 3 different shades of green and 1 shade of yellow/orange.
I wanted to use these types of colors for the website as it would be fitting to the nature based theming of the website.

I next used a website called ColorSpace to help generate values to make more complimentary shades of green. I used the original dark green hex to base the other shades on.

To find a new yellow/orange color I used the same website with initial color set to the new shade of green '#579A47' and found a fitting shade under the 'Skip Shade' section.

With the final color palette chosen I used ContrastGrids to check each colors contrast with each other.

Here is the final color palette together using Coolors once more:

### Font / Icons

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to source the fonts used for this website.

For headings and website title I used [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald)

For general text and nav bar I used [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round)

### Imagery

All the photos and video on my website were found on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) except for the map image.
The link to each piece of media can be found in the credits section.

I chose to use releastic images for my website as I felt the imagery needed to be similar to what you might see if you go to this fictional zoo.

I also wanted to pick images and videos that had a lot of greenery. This would match well with the color palette of my website.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

![Picture of full nav-bar](/doc-media/nav-1280w.png)

My navigation bar features the title of the website along with anchors to the 4 main pages that will be discussed below.
Clicking the title or 'home' on any page will have the same function of bringing the user to the home page / index.html

![Picture of mobile nav-bar closed](/doc-media/navclose-480w.png)

When on a small / mobile screen the navigation bar will feature the title of the website and a burger icon to open the other navigation links.

![Picture of mobile nav-bar open](/doc-media/navopen-480w.png)

Clicking on the burger icon will reveal to the user the remaing anchor links to the other pages.

### Home

The home page features 3 main things:

- General Info, text to welcome the user and explain the website.
- Opening hours, showing the user when the zoo will be open on different days.
- Map, an image showing what attractions are featured at the zoo and where they are in relation to other things.

![Picture of home screen large](/doc-media/home-1280w.png)

On a larger screen size the general info and opening hours section will be feature horizontally.

![Picture of home screen mobile](/doc-media/home-480w.png)

Whereas on mobile the will be featured vertically with general info coming first.
Both variations have the map featured last.

### Animals

### Contact Us

### Footer

### Extra Pages

### Future Features

1. Home page interactable map:
   - First option would be to have the map remain how it is currently but add the functionality to click parts of the map to go to different pages on the site.
   - Second option would be to replace the map with one that embeds something like Google maps to find the location of the zoo itself.
2. Animal page update:
   - Additional animals talked about. Currently there is 3 featured, there could easily be 6+ on the animal page.
   - Interactions and animations could be added to this page also to make it more engaging for users.
